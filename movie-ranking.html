<h1>THE TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h1>

<h2>PERSONAL REVIEW</h2>

<hr />

<h3>THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY</h3>
<p>LOTR  represents something so magical yet realistic, watching lotr is like scartching that part of your brain that iches.</p>

<h3>THE PIRATES OF CARIBBEAN</h3>
<p>First watched this movie when i was a small kid who didnt understand the complex dialogues, but this movie had something which made that boy glue himself to the tv screen. no matter how may times you watch this movie it still remians a fresh new experience each time.</p>

<h3>THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA</h3>
<p>'For narnia and for aslan' hearing this was the first time i got goosebumps, this will always be my comfort movie. Narnia is nostalgic to me, takes me back to a time when i was the happiest.</p>
